# Dawood Hamayun — Product Engineer (Full-Stack)

I build **modern web products** with a strong UX sense and the engineering depth to back it up — from **0 → shipped**, with real users and real constraints in mind.

## About

I’m a builder who cares about *how things feel* **and** *how they hold up*.

## 🎯 How I Work (What You’d Notice)

I like shipping work that creates obvious wins for teams:

- **makes messy information easier to understand**
- **reduces repetitive work** with automation that still feels transparent
- **turns “multi-step complexity” into a guided experience**
- **creates reusable outputs** (reports, exports, saved artifacts) — not one-off screens
- feels steady under pressure: **large inputs, edge cases, retries, real-world usage**
